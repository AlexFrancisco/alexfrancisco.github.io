As an automation engineer I have become a "jack-of-all-trades" when it comes to IT.  This is due to my on-going experience in creating automated workflows for critical business processes.  This requires in-depth knowledge of various operating systems, data processing platforms and software solutions.  The development of these workflows also requires analytical and critical thinking in terms of resource usage and workload management.  This makes creating automating workflows a unique and challenging task due to the complexity of most business processes. 

Technology aside, I also have a unique perspective on the IT industry as I have worked closely in daily production operations, first level support and development.  Having worked in law enforcement, health care, finance and other industries, I have had the opprotunity to see a broad range of IT processes and their implementations.  Each shop maintains their own incident, change and project management processes and I have played a key role in each of them. By understanding the differences and similarities of how various companies run their shops, I am able to identify and avoid common pitfalls as well as smoothly transision my work into reliable solutions.   

My goals as a growing engineer, developer and manager is to; utilize source control tools to manage all critical artificats, normalize processes and procedures utilized by peers and create robust solutions that are vendor/platform agnostic.  Though this blog, I plan to log my journey as I work towards these goals, learn new techologies, building unique software solutions and provide insight from my own experiences in the IT industry.
